Interview Experience

Round-1(ONLINE TEST): It was an online test on Hackerrank. There were two questions given and they were of easy-medium difficulty. 
All the popular programming languages were available to choose from for writing the code.

Round-2(DSA and Problem-Solving round): It lasted about an hour. First I introduced myself and was asked about my current role in 
the company I work for, then he jumped on to DSA questions. I was asked two questions:-

https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-elements-with-greatest-element-on-right-side/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-all-duplicate-adjacent-characters-from-a-string-using-stack/
We have finally come up with the most optimal solution for each question. 

Round-3(DSA and Problem-Solving round): This also lasted about an hour. First I introduced myself then he jumped on to DSA questions. 
I was asked two questions:-

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-smallest-positive-number-missing-from-an-unsorted-array/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/burn-the-binary-tree-starting-from-the-target-node/
We have finally come up with the most optimal solution for each question. The time was not sufficient for the second question, so 
didnâ€™t code it just discussed the approach.
