Round 3: Coding round

This was also a coding-based interview round of 45 minutes. This time first interviewer asked me about my self and short description of one of the projects mentioned 
in my resume. Then he asked me a question related to sliding window maximum approach (but in 2-D matrix kind of). Interviewer was not interested in me writing code but
wanted to know how Iâ€™ll be able to reach the solution. We firstly discussed brute force approach, their time and space complexity. Then he asked me for further 
optimization, and then so on till we reached to the best complexities. After that I wrote the code in google docs shared with interviewer while explaining each line of 
code. I ended up doing dry run of my code with given examples and some different test cases. We closed our session by just discussing about worst cases space 
complexities.
