Technical Interview: (September 2022.)

There was only 1 round and I attended it in the Amazon office.
The interview lasted for around 1 hour and I need to solve 2 coding questions. 
1st coding question: (on strings)

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reduce-the-string-by-removing-k-consecutive-identical-characters/

First I told the brute force approach and then the interviewer asked me to optimize it. 
I gave him the solution using stack, and I was asked to write the code on paper. 
Then for the second question, he asked me whether I am comfortable with Trees. I said YES, but I was actually not.
He gave me the question: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-duplicate-subtrees/
I couldn’t solve it, so he changed the question.

2nd coding question: Then he changed the question to Find the number of permutations of a given pattern in a given string.

My approach was:

Store the frequency of each character in the pattern on a map.
Traverse the string, like the sliding window technique, and store the frequency of each substring of the pattern’s length.
Compare the frequencies and if it matches, increase the count of results.
Update the frequency of the substring for every window.
The interviewer was quite impressed with my solution and I was asked to write the code for it. We had a small discussion on my projects and also his experience at Amazon.

Result: SELECTED (Got mail after a week)
