Technical Interview: (September 2022.)

There was only 1 round and I attended it in the Amazon office.
The interview lasted for around 1 hour and I need to solve 2 coding questions. 
1st coding question: (on strings)

First I told the brute force approach and then the interviewer asked me to optimize it. 
I gave him the solution using stack, and I was asked to write the code on paper. 
Then for the second question, he asked me whether I am comfortable with Trees. I said YES, but I was actually not.
He gave me the question: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-duplicate-subtrees/
I couldnâ€™t solve it, so he changed the question.
